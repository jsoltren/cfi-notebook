\chapter{Multi Engine Airplanes}

Do you want to fly the ``big iron''? Are you looking for more performance, capability,
and reliability? Do you enjoy engine management (and maintenance) so much that you want to
double the fun? If so, the multi engine airplane is for you.

This chapter is meant to prepare the prospective multi engine pilot or instructor for the
fun that is to come.

The material in this section is based upon FAA resources, as well as the Multiengine Manual
that Pilot's Choice Aviation in Georgetown, TX distributes to incoming multi engine students.
Credit is due to Beth Ann Jenkins and Stephanie LASTNAME for their substantial comtributions.
