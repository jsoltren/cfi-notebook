\section{Engine Failure in Flight (above 3000' AGL)}

\subsection{Procedures}

\textbf{Maintain directional control!}

\textbf{ALL AVAILABLE POWER:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{PITCH FOR \textcolor{blue}{BLUE LINE} - \vyse (85 KIAS),\\OR maintain altitude at a higher airspeed if able.}
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{red}{MIXTURES} SET (max available power)}
    \item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{PROPELLERS} Full Forward}
    \item \textbf{THROTTLES Full Power}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{CLEAN UP:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{FLAPS UP (or as required)}
    \item \textbf{GEAR UP (or as required)}
    \item \textbf{Trim and bank into good engine.}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{IDENTIFY/VERIFY:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{IDENTIFY Dead foot = dead engine.}
    \item \textbf{VERIFY Power idle on dead engine. No change in performance - verified.}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{FIX OR FEATHER:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DECISION Based upon situation/altitude (Restart or Feather?)}
\end{itemize}

Rarely do engines fail suddenly and completely (fuel starvation is the exception). If an engine is running poorly, but
developing some power, \textbf{you are better off letting it run} (above 3000 AGL) until you sort out the problem. The
decision to feather should be made with some deliberation. A catastrophic engine failure would require feathering
the engine (avoiding a potential fire), however, a rough running engine should not be feathered as any horsepower it
is producing potentially helps.

\textbf{The exception is during a critical phase of flight}, such as initial climb-out,
approach or landing. During these phases of flight the propeller on the problem engine should be feathered
immediately, as there is not enough time to safely perform the fix procedures. Maintaining aircraft control is
\emph{the priority} and you should land as soon and as safely as possible.

\textbf{FIX:}

\textbf{CHECK (\textcolor{red}{Red Items}) - only on affected engine.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fuel - ON}
    \item \textbf{Carburetor Heat - ON}
    \item \textbf{Mixture - SET (max available power)}
    \item \textbf{Boost Pumps - ON}
    \item \textbf{Magnetos - CYCLE Left - Right - Both}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{WARNING} Feathering the wrong engine is incredibly dangerous!
Work methodically to make certain the correct engine is feathered.}

\textbf{FEATHER:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Feather Propeller on inoperative engine.}
    \item \textbf{Power as needed on good engine to maintain altitude/airspeed.\\Minimum speed: \textcolor{blue}{BLUE LINE 85 KIAS}.}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Memory aid: 3\degree{} bank for slip.}

\textbf{SHUTDOWN AND SECURE ENGINE:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mixture - Idle Cutoff}
    \item \textbf{Fuel Selector - OFF}
    \item \textbf{Cowl Flaps - Open on operative engine, closed on inoperative engine.}
    \item \textbf{Fuel Pump - OFF}
    \item \textbf{Magnetos - OFF}
    \item \textbf{Alternator Switch - OFF}
    \item \textbf{Notify ATC.}
    \item \textbf{Land as soon as practical.}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{** NOW REFER TO CHECKLIST. **}}


\section{Engine Failure During or After Takeoff}

\subsection{Procedures}

{\centering
\textbf{DURING INITIAL CLIMB OUT THE NOSE NEEDS TO BE LOWERED\\
5 DEGREES OR MORE TO MAINTAIN 85 KIAS!!!}
\par }

Bank approximately \textbf{3 degrees} toward the good engine with the rudder ball half out toward the good engine. This
will provide maximum climb performance. \textbf{Each degree of bank back toward the inoperative engine increases \vmc
by 3 knots per degree. Therefore, with only a 2 degree bank toward the operative engine, \vmc might be 3 knots higher
than published.}

If the pilot inadvertently or instinctively tries to hold wings level in an engine out situation, \vmc
\textbf{CAN INCREASE AS MUCH AS 15 KNOTS. THE AIRCRAFT COULD BE UNCONTROLLABLE AT A
SPEED AS HIGH AS \vyse!} This situation \textbf{WILL EXIST} if the pilot flies wings level and tries to maintain heading
with the ball centered.

\emph{Memory aid: Raise the dead (engine).}

\subsection{Power-Loss Briefing (Before Takeoff)}

A power loss briefing is to be given before takeoff to remind the pilot of the actions to be taken in the event of a
power loss during or after the takeoff roll. Time is critical so actions must be immediate but deliberate.

\bfseries{

Loss of directional control on the ground:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Throttles - IDLE
    \item Regain Control (mostly rudder)
    \item Brake straight ahead
\end{itemize}

Airborne loss of directional control: usable runway remaining and gear down:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Throttles – IDLE
    \item Land
    \item Brake straight ahead
\end{itemize}

Airborne loss of directional control: no usable runway remaining or gear up:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All available power (maintain Heading and Blue Line):
    \item Clean Up
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[\ding{226}] Flaps – UP
            \item[\ding{226}] Gear – UP
        \end{itemize}
    \item Identify dead engine
    \item Verify dead engine
    \item Feather dead engine
    \item Return for landing
\end{itemize}
