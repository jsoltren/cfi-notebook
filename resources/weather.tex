\chapter{Weather}

Much as a submarine flies through the water, so too does an airplane fly through the air. Think of the atmosphere as a diverse, swirling, active mix of fluids - gases - creating pressure differentials and swirls and vortices and other phenomena. Weather is simply the study of these phenomena.

Once upon a time the authority on the FAA's weather resources was \href{https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1030235}{AC 00-45H - Aviation Weather Services - Change 2}. As of 2022-12-22, that document is cancelled, in favor of the all encompassing \href{https://www.faa.gov/regulationspolicies/handbooksmanuals/aviation/faa-h-8083-28-aviation-weather-handbook}{FAA-H-8083-28, Aviation Weather Handbook}. That document is a primary reference for this chapter.

The new Handbook - all 532 pages of it - incorporates information from a number of now cancelled advisory circulars:

\begin{itemize}
\item AC 00-6, Aviation Weather.
\item AC 00-24, Thunderstorms.
\item AC 00-30, Clear Air Turbulence Avoidance.
\item AC 00-45, Aviation Weather Services.
\item AC 00-54, Pilot Windshear Guide.
\item AC 00-57, Hazardous Mountain Winds.
\end{itemize}
