\chapter{The Commercial Pilot}

So you want to become a commercial pilot? What are the privileges and limitations for such a pilot? What does that even mean?

One thing is for certain: the private pilot checkride is NOT simply a "glorified commercial pilot checkride". The expectations - and risks - for a commercial pilot are much higher.

Think of it this way. The private pilot checkride represents your first flight with a passenger (albeit a fairly picky one at that). The commercial pilot checkride is meant to simulate your first \emph{job interview} as a pilot. It's all about professionalism, polish, and positive control.

The private pilot checkride is your change to demonstrate competence. The commercial pilot checkride demonstrates fluency, professionalism, experience, and finesse. Of course, the ATP checkride takes this to another level, but we'll talk about that another day.
